          <p class="primary--text">Born in 1995 in Simi Valley, California, I started playing flute at the age of nine and very quickly fell
            in love with music.
             <br /><br />
            In high school, I took multiple band classes every year, and learned to play the saxophone in
            jazz band in addition to participating in concert band. I first started composing at the age of 16, when I wrote
            my first piece for my high school jazz band.
             <br /><br />
            However, it wasnâ€™t until college that I really found my passion for
            composing music. I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in composition from California State University, Fresno where I
            studied with Dr. Kenneth Froelich and Dr. Benjamin Boone.
             <br /><br />
            I have written music for large ensembles like concert band
            and orchestra, as well as chamber music for string quartet, flute ensemble, duets, trios and even solo voice. I had
            many pieces performed while I was at Fresno State, and most recently have been composing works by commission as I prepares
            to start my masters degree.
            <br /><br />
            I currently resides in Fresno, California and am working for the Fresno Philharmonic.
